Test whether lfs is working as my expectation

Currently lfs is hard to install in windows. So if I want the download zip file can contain the binary files I want to distribute. Also I want to be able to prune an old version of my binary file.

This test failed. I view the file in github webpage, but it is not included in the zip file.

For organization, there is 1G storage limitation, how can I delete an old version of binary file? Should every version be counted once? How much space for regular git repo?

https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/. This is a way for distributing binary files.
