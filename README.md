Test whether lfs is working as my expectation

Currently lfs is hard to install in windows. So if I want the download zip file can contain the binary files I want to distribute. Also I want to be able to prune an old version of my binary file.

For organization, there is 1G storage limitation, how can I delete an old version of binary file? Should every version be counted once? How much space for regular git repo?
